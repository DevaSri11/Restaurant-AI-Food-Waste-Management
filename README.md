# AI Food Waste Tracker in Restaurants
## Restaurant AI Management System
A web application designed to track and analyze food waste in restaurants using AI-powered insights and data visualization.

## Project Overview
The Restaurant AI Management System is a web-based application built to help restaurants track and reduce food waste. The system uses AI-powered insights and data visualization to provide actionable recommendations and automate data collection.

## Problem Statement & Goals
The problem of food waste in restaurants is a significant one, with millions of tons of food being wasted every year. The goal of this system is to provide a solution to this problem by tracking and analyzing food waste in restaurants and providing actionable recommendations to reduce it. The system aims to achieve the following goals:
- Track food waste in restaurants
- Analyze food waste data to identify trends and patterns
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce food waste
- Automate data collection and reporting

## Domain Concept Explanation
Food waste tracking and analysis is a critical concept in the restaurant industry. The system interprets this concept by tracking the amount of food waste generated by each restaurant and analyzing the data to identify trends and patterns. The system uses AI-powered insights to provide actionable recommendations to reduce food waste.

## Solution Approach
The system solves the problem of food waste tracking and analysis by using a combination of AI-powered insights and data visualization. The system automates data collection and provides actionable recommendations to reduce food waste. The system uses the following technologies:
- **React** for building the web application
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- Recharts for **data visualization**
- **Google GenAI** for AI-powered insights
- **QR code-based system** for easy tracking and monitoring of food waste and feedback analys

## Technical Architecture
The system architecture consists of the following components:
```
+---------------+
|  Frontend    |
+---------------+
       |
       |
       v
+---------------+
|  Backend     |
+---------------+
       |

|  Database    |
+---------------+
       |
       |
       v
+---------------+
|  External    |
|  Services    |
+---------------+
```
The frontend is built using React and React Router, and is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling client-side routing. The backend is built using Node.js and is responsible for handling API requests and interacting with the database. The database is used to store food waste data and other relevant information. The external services include Google GenAI for AI-powered insights and QR code-based system for easy tracking and monitoring of food waste.

## Key Components & Implementation Details
The system consists of the following key components:
- `App.tsx`: The main application component that renders the user interface
- `components`: A folder that contains reusable UI components
- `constants.ts`: A file that contains constant values used throughout the application
- `contexts`: A folder that contains context API components
- `github`: A folder that contains GitHub-related files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that renders the application
- `index.tsx`: The main entry point of the application
- `metadata.json`: A file that contains metadata about the application
- `package-lock.json`: A file that contains dependencies and their versions
- `package.json`: A file that contains dependencies and scripts
- `pages`: A folder that contains page components
- `services`: A folder that contains API services
- `tsconfig.json`: A file that contains TypeScript configuration
- `types.ts`: A file that contains type definitions

## System Logic / Analytics Insights
The system uses a combination of AI-powered insights and data visualization to provide actionable recommendations to reduce food waste. The system tracks food waste data and analyzes it to identify trends and patterns. The system uses the following workflows:
- Data collection: The system collects food waste data from restaurants
- Data analysis: The system analyzes the collected data to identify trends and patterns
- Recommendation generation: The system generates actionable recommendations to reduce food waste based on the analyzed data

## Usage / Workflow
The system can be used by restaurants to track and reduce food waste. The system provides a user-friendly interface that allows restaurants to input food waste data and view analytics insights. The system can be used in the following ways:
- Single-user mode: A single user can input food waste data and view analytics insights
- Batch mode: Multiple users can input food waste data and view analytics insights in batch mode
- API mode: The system provides an API that allows restaurants to integrate the system with their existing systems

## Folder Structure
The system has the following folder structure:
```
restaurant-ai-management-system/
|-- .github
|-- .gitignore
|-- App.tsx
|-- README.md
